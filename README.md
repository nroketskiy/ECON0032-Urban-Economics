# ECON0032-Urban-Economics

This is a set of notes for the practical session of the course in Urban Economics taught by me at UCL. I would like to thank Zuzanna Urbanska for her help in creating these notes.

You can use either the Jupyter journal version or a pdf version of the notes (the latter display math equations properly).

If you would like to use these notes, please contact me at n.roketskiy@ucl.ac.uk

Best wishes, 

Nikita Roketskiy
